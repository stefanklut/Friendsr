## Description
An app that lets you rate your friends (or in our case GoT characters). 
The starting interface is a grid with three columns that shows all the friends.
When one of the friends is clicked, the app shows a new interface with more detailed information.
On this screen is also a rating bar. The rating value is saved on the phone so that it can't be lost,
even after the phone is shut down.
